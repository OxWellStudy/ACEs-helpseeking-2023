## The OxWell Student Survey

The [OxWell Student Survey](https://oxwell.org) is a repeated cross-sectional survey of primary and secondary school students in England. The survey asks students to self-report on a wide range of factors related to mental health and well-being. The study protocol is available at [BMJ Open 2021;11:e052717. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052717](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/12/e052717.info).
